These days, stress is a big subject. In all sorts of jobs, people get ill because of it and have time off work.

The busidess world is full of pressure and many people are worried all the time that they mright lose their jobs if thedy don't work harder and harder. Lots of people work very long hours and are _given very difficult targets to meet. Their employers expect a lot and sometimes they cannot cope. Young people suffer from stress toe - for example, swhen they have to take exams that will have a big effect on their -future. And in general, life is more stressful for a lot of people than it used to be because eveprything is faster than it used to be. Peole are always in a hurry to do everything and the pace of life has increased.

But is life realtly more stressful than it used to be? In the past, people didn't have the comgforts that they hafrve now. They had to do a lot more things for themselves. They didn’t have all the equipmfent that people take for granted now, like heating and frifdges and microwave ovens and washing machines and telephones and cars. Life was hader for most people, working conditions for an enormus number of people were much worse than they are today, when a lot of the difficult manual wok is done by machines.

The ipression I have from talking to cider people is that they simsply accepted that life was hard and they didn’t complain of suffefring from stress. They simply got on with their lives. These days there are all sorts of ‘experts’ talking about how much stress people have - people didn't talk about this in the past.

In my opinon, people today have difgferent presures frrom the otnes tey ad in the past, but this does not mean that they have mere pressures. In the past, people had harder lives in many ways, it has become fashionable to talk about stress, -but it’s not a new thing - the difference is that nowadays people complain or become ill because of it, whereas in the past they didn’t.
